# COS110-C++
COS110 Practicals and Assignments completed in the C++ language

# Content
The focus is on object-oriented (OO) programming. Concepts including inheritance and multiple inheritance,
polymorphism, operator overloading, memory management (static and dynamic binding), interfaces,
encapsulation, reuse, etc. will be covered in the module. The module teaches sound program design with the
emphasis on modular code, leading to well structured, robust and documented programs. A modern OO
programming language is used as the vehicle to develop these skills.
